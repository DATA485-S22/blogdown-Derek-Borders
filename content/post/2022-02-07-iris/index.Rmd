# Iris  

The famous Iris data set is the 'Hello World' of data science.  

It's small enough to be easy to understand at a glance, but large enough to have some interesting and demonstrative properties. It's great for exploring predictive and classification models, for regression and clustering and for unsupervised and supervised machine learning techniques.

Iris is just fun and colorful in a way that appeals to the kid in all of us. It doesn't hurt that it's an innocent dataset with no sociopolitical baggage either. 

I personally love the set and I like to dust it off when trying out new languages and tools.

## The Data  

The Iris dataset contains 150 observations of five variables. There are 50 observations each for the three species of iris: Setosa, Versicolor, and Verginica. Each observation gives the length and width (in centimeters) of the petals and sepals of the flowers. 

## What is a sepal anyway?

I like to include a picture at this point because, until I encountered this set, 'sepal' was not part of my personal vocabulary. I didn't even have a guess as to what a sepal was without a picture. Hell, I couldn't even have picked an Iris out of a lineup of a few flowers, despite growing up with some in the yard (I think, they were purple, at any rate).

## 3 Species, 2 Clusters

One interesting thing about this set is that versicolor and virginica are very similar in the four measurements we observe, while setosa is very different from either of them. When we model and plot this set, we find it difficult to distinguish between versicolor and virginica, while setosa jumps off the page using pretty much any model or plot. We can see from the included image that this absolutely makes sense. 

## Classic Scatter Plot

A basic scatter plot of petal width and length is one classic way to see what we're talking about.

```{r, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo=F)
knitr::opts_chunk$set(warning=F)
knitr::opts_chunk$set(message=F)
knitr::opts_chunk$set(error=F)
```


```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(datasets)
library(viridis)
library(hrbrthemes)

df <- iris

ggplot(df, aes(Petal.Width, Petal.Length, color=Species)) +
  geom_point() +
  theme_ipsum(base_family="sans")
  
```

Definitely flesh this out into something because the other Derek is making you look like a chump.
