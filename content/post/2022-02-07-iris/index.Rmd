# Iris  

The Iris data set is the 'Hello World' of data science.  

It's small enough to be easy to understand at a glance, but large enough to have some interesting and demonstrative properties. It's great for exploring predictive and classification models, for regression and clustering and for unsupervised and supervised machine learning techniques.

It's also just fun and colorful in a way that appeals to the kid in all of us. 

I personally love the set and I like to pull it out and play with it when trying out new languages and tools. 

## The Data  

The Iris dataset contains 50 observations each of the length and width of the petals and sepals of three species of irises (150 total sample size). 

## What is a sepal anyway?

I like to include a picture because, until I encountered this set, 'sepal' was not part of my personal vocabulary. I didn't even have a guess as to what a sepal was without a picture. Hell, I couldn't even have picked an Iris out of a lineup of a few flowers, despite growing up with some in the yard.

## 3 Species, 2 Clusters

One interesting thing about this set is that versicolor and virginica are very similar in the four measurements we observe, while setosa is very different from either of them. When we model and plot this set, we find it difficult to distinguish between versicolor and virginica, while setosa jumps off the page using pretty much any model or plot. We can see from the included image that this absolutely makes sense. 

## Classic Scatter Plot

A basic scatter plot of petal width and length is one classic way to see what we're talking about.

```{r, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo=F)
knitr::opts_chunk$set(warning=F)
knitr::opts_chunk$set(message=F)
knitr::opts_chunk$set(error=F)
```


```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(datasets)
library(viridis)
library(hrbrthemes)

df <- iris

ggplot(df, aes(Petal.Width, Petal.Length, color=Species)) +
  geom_point() +
  theme_ipsum(base_family="sans")
  
```

Definitely flesh this out into something because the other Derek is making you look like a chump.
