<h1>Iris</h1>
<p>Iris is sort of the ‘Hello World’ of data science. I like to use it when trying out new languages and tools.</p>
<div id="the-data" class="section level2">
<h2>The Data</h2>
<p>The Iris dataset contains 50 observations each of the length and width of the petals and sepals of three species of irises (150 total sample size). I like to include a picture because until I encountered this set ‘sepal’ was not part of my personal vocabulary.</p>

<p>One interesting thing about this set is that versicolor and virginica are very similar in the four measurements we observe, while setosa is very different from either of them. When we model and plot this set, we find it difficult to distinguish between versicolor and virginica, while setosa jumps off the page using pretty much any model or plot. We can see from the included image that this absolutely makes sense.</p>
<p>A basic scatter plot of petal width and length is one classic way to see what we’re talking about.</p>
